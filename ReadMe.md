# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple reader-writer lock: a synchronization primitive that allows concurrent access for read-only operations, and exclusive access for write operations.

# Environment
The project builds and runs with Visual Studio Community 2022 when the required workloads are installed.
